### Object Oriented Calculator
![Calculator](https://github.com/Designer998/B.2019O.Portfolio/blob/master/Calc/Calc.png)

This Calculator has most of the original functions of a normal calculator, besides the High and Low random number function. I programmed this with a different layout than an original calculator, which can be nice for a little change in somthing this common.

### Moving Cars

This app shows moving cars with different speeds and included trucks as well as cars (size and position difference). This can be used as a screensavor, though the speed should deffinitely be slowed if it is to work well (for the computer and you).

### World Civilizations Time Line
![TimeLine](https://github.com/Designer998/B.2019O.Portfolio/blob/master/TimeLine/TimeLine.png)

I made this app for a project in World Civilizations, and so it shows the different civilizations and gives relatively important information about each. It provides an interactive experience (semi-interactive) for the user, and is filled with color so that it isn't extremely dull.
