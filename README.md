### Object Oriented Calculator

This Calculator has most of the original functions of a normal calculator, besides the High and Low random number function. I programmed this with a different layout than an original calculator, which can be nice for a little change in somthing this common.

### Moving Cars

This app shows moving cars with different speeds and included trucks as well as cars (size and position difference). This can be used as a screensavor, though the speed should deffinitely be slowed if it is to work well (for the computer and you).
