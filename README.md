### Object Oriented Calculator
![Calculator](https://github.com/Designer998/B.2019O.Portfolio/blob/master/Calc/Calc.png?raw=true)

This Calculator has most of the original functions of a normal calculator, besides the High and Low random number function. I programmed this with a different layout than an original calculator, which can be nice for a little change in somthing this common.

### Moving Cars
![Moving cars](https://github.com/Designer998/B.2019O.Portfolio/blob/master/Cars/Cars.png?raw=true)

This app shows moving cars with different speeds and included trucks as well as cars (size and position difference). This can be used as a screensavor, though the speed should deffinitely be slowed if it is to work well (for the computer and you).

### Shape Calculator
![ShapeTester](https://github.com/Designer998/B.2019O.Portfolio/blob/master/ShapeTester/ShapeTester.png?raw=true)

This is a useful app, as it can calculate the Volume and the Surface Area of 3 shapes: Cubes, Spheres, and Pyramids. This list might continue, as I'll update it with new shapes and maybe add a GUI. As you can see, it asks you questions about what you want it to calculate, and in return you answer with a letter, word, and number.

### Line Mapping
![Lines](https://github.com/Designer998/B.2019O.Portfolio/blob/master/Lines/Lines.png?raw=true)

This app can be used as a screensavor and you can change the lightness of the lines to make the lines black, white, gray, etc. It starts a ton of lines at random points and goes all over, turning randomly and making intricate designs.

### World Civilizations Time Line
![TimeLine](https://github.com/Designer998/B.2019O.Portfolio/blob/master/TimeLine/TimeLine.png?raw=true)

I made this app for a project in World Civilizations, and so it shows the different civilizations and gives relatively important information about each. It provides an interactive experience (semi-interactive) for the user, and is filled with color so that it isn't extremely dull.
