### Object Oriented Calculator
![Calculator](https://github.com/Designer998/B.2019O.Portfolio/blob/master/Calc/Calc.png)

This Calculator has most of the original functions of a normal calculator, besides the High and Low random number function. I programmed this with a different layout than an original calculator, which can be nice for a little change in somthing this common.
