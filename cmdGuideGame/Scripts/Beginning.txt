Start: ^You wake up to the sounds of alarms and people running around frantically^
^You hear the general ordering people around^
^He barks something about loss, but you don't understand [about how we lost them during the night]^
^You sit up, looking all around to identify your location^ // Ben
^You stand, realizing that you're at a military post near the front lines^ // Ben
^Out of the corner of your eye you see a suspicious shadow darting behind a corner^
^Do you...^

^1a) Follow the shadow around the corner^
^You dart up out of bed and chase the shadow, you yell at it but the figure keeps running^
^Right before you go around the corner, a large door closes and locks^
^The door blocks you from chasing the shadow any farther^ ^You see a hallway to the side^
^You could take the long way around and try to catch up with the shadow[1b]^
^or try to open the door[2b]^

^2a) Ignore the shadow and help the general^
^you shrug off the shadow and assume you must still be half asleep^
^you get up and get your gear and head over to the general^
^He's yelling and mad^
^he points at you with orders to help set up a perimeter on the east side of the base^
^He tells you to not let anyone in or out without his authorization^
^on your way outside you catch a glimpse of movement^
^You look in that direction but dont see anything^
^One of your officers yells at you to get to your post^
^You could disobey orders and investigate the movement [1d]^
^You could ignore it and follow the general's orders by heading to your post [2d]^

^1b)^
^You take off sprinting down the hallway trying to gain a little lost ground on the shadow^
^when your hallway meets back up with the main hallway you see the figure at the end^
^you lock eyes with the shadow for a split second^
^You're not sure from where but you recognize them^
^they take off again but they drop a piece of paper^
^You grab the piece of paper and read it^ ^or at least you try to but it just looks like giberish^
^You could report what happened back to the general [1c]^
^You could keep this a secret and return the general [2c]^

^2b)^
^You turn to the key pad next to the door and start entering your access code^
^you enter your code and the door unlocks and you open it^
^you dont see a trace of the person and look around for a minute^
^You turn around and see a couple of your squadmates jogging over to you^
^they ask you what happened and why you took off running^
^you tell them you saw someone running this way^
^they look at you like you are crazy and they say that you are needed back in the main room^
^you give up and follow them^
^The general says that some of the prisoners have escaped and they had help^
^You could report what happened [1e]^ ^You could await orders[2e]^
