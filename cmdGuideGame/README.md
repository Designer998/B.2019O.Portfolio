## Command Prompt Guide

### A4 C++ Group
#### GroupMembers: Colin Oremland, Ben Ogden, Mikhail Kano

This project will be very similar to the "Terminus" game that guides the user in learning how to use the Terminal. 
I'm planning to do the same thing with the Command Prompt for Windows, which also guides the reader through a 
semi-medium level language of CMD prompt.I want it to be compatible with Mac OS first, then Windows OS, and finally Linux. 
OR I just have run on a web server for virtual universal compatibility. CODE-BEHIND: visual and the output and the user input 
is dealt with on the web, while the code is ran from a different source and connects to web page -- Terminus.

### Story ideas:
Virtual computer (in story. Tasks are required to do in order keep it running - includes viruses and power downs that appear/occur randomly (but reasonably) at times. Perhaps the computer OS is MS-DOS, the bare minimal of an OS and the base of CMD.
